# StochasticTurbulenceGeneration
Python code to generate passive 3d+time fields representing a passive scalar being convected by Kolmogorov turbulence.

The method and some background is described in the Master's thesis 
H. Gingsj√∂, "Modelling and simulation of tropospheric water vapour with gaussian random fields - Time dependence beyond the frozen flow hypothesis", M.S. thesis, Department of Space, Earth and Environment, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, 2018.

Dependencies:
Python 2 or 3 (should be version agnostic) with modules cython, numpy and scipy. The small visualization program additionally requires pyqtgraph and OpenGL.
(Probably plus some more that I've forgotten about)


A visualization program that can show some sample realizations of random 3D-fields with different statistics can be run with
```bash
python visualizingGUI.py
```


To run the software first run
```bash
python compile_cython.py build_ext --inplace
```

to compile the cython file "cone.pyx" used for generating integration weights for radiometer cones.

Then try
```bash
python example_config.py
```

which will run a basic simulation.


This creates a directory called 'example' in which a cache file, weight_cache.pkl, and an output file, example_out_000.npy, are written. If the code is run again it will generate an independent realization and store that in example_out_001.npy, and so on.

The files can be loaded using numpy as follows:
```python
import numpy as np
signals = np.load('example_out_000.npy')
```

Now signals is a 2d array where the first column, `signals[:,0]`, is the timestamps when the process was sampled and the other columns, `signals[:,1:]`, are line integrals over the refractivity field. Parameters for those lines are stored in weight_cache.pkl.

It could be nice to have the output in a '.mat'-file containing both the generated time series and information about the geometry. It would only take a few minutes to add that feature.
